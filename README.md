### Hi I'm Viktor Strate ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student ðŸ“š at the University of Southern Denmark. I'm also a freelance web designer.
I strongly believe in the spirit of open-source software, and I use much of my spare time working on projects here on GitHub.

I mainly focus on Photoview, a self-hosted photo gallery that I've been regularly working on for a while now.
