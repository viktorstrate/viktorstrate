### Hi I'm Viktor Strate ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Southern Denmark. I've also been a freelance web designer for many years.
I strongly believe in the spirit of open-source software, and I use much of my spare time working on projects here on GitHub.

I mainly focus on Photoview, a self-hosted photo gallery that I've been regularly working on for a while now.
